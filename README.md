# Background # 

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

## Instructions ##

This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## Part 1: WeatherPy ##

In this deliverable, created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Used the **citipy** Python **libraryLinks** to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and created a representative model of weather across cities.

For this part, I used the **WeatherPy.ipynb** Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code guided me through the process of using my Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
